## Wall setup thoughts

When you have setup openGrid on your wall you normally will want to attach things like shelves and
holders. Attaching those to your board can be done using direct custom snaps. However for this quickstart
tutorial we will be using the Multiconnect system, thats independant from openGrid and also supporting
different solutions (like HSW or Multiboard), but also has great support with openGrid as well.

The main advantages of Multiconnect for this quickstart guide are:

* Easy setup and usage.
* Allows you to move any accessories pretty easily.
* Allows you to reuse existing accessories (for some cases).

## Multiconnect

The multiconnect system is based on a simple connector head you can then use to mount anything to your
board. It works best when gravity is involved (like when you have the board mounted onto your wall), but
is also suitable for other cases.

To attach something to your board using Multiconnect you basically just slide the accessory back over the
Multiconnect heads attached to your board.
