## Cable management using Underware

Underware for openGrid is based on the [original design by Hands on Katie](https://www.printables.com/model/941161-underware-the-ultimate-cable-management-solution)
but adapts it to be used on openGrid more easily.

Underware's main focus is doing cable management in an easy and elegant way - while have things looking
nice. For this Underware uses an extensive set of different cable channels and various other parts. The
cable channels are somewhat a housing for the cables so you don't see those hanging around any more.

The main advantages of Underware on openGrid are:

* Easy setup and usage.
* Hides cables inside channels to everything looks and feels clean.
* Very quick access to your cables if you need to.

## Attaching a standard channel

To attach one channel to your board you simply put one side of the channel grips into the board, then rotate the
other side in while pinching the channel just a little bit. You may put the cable into the channel first, especially
when the board is mounted under your desk.

For different variants of the channel you may need to pinch the channels more if necessary. For assembling you whole

## Underware based snaps

Underware might be supported by different snaps as well. The ones we need to mention for the quickstart guide would be

* The Underware channel base snap
* The Underware grip channel snap

The **channel base snap** is used to bring back a base for the channel. This may be useful if you want to push cables through
the channel and keep getting stick at the board edges. Also the channel base has some cutouts that allow you to attach the
channel base to your cable using a zip tie. This may be useful to setup the base layout of your installation first and
later only cover things up using the channels.

The **grip channel snap** will ensure your channel is more tightly gripping onto the board. It is places below a channel and
will push the channel grips outwards, so the channel does not fall off easily. Use this snap to improve the strength of
the channel by a lot. May help in those scenarios when you put a lot of cabled into one channel for example.

Have fun printing and using openGrid!
