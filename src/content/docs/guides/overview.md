openGrid is an open source board system created by DavidD.  
It is intended to be a living-room compatible grid base with many options to attach things on to it. 

## Goals

- living room compatible
- use less filament than other common comparable frameworks
- be compatible to existing solutions out there (like gridfinity)
- be open and allow people to extend things

## Begin your jurney

Here's how to begin:

- Choose your tile type: `Full` or `Lite`
- Set dimensions (e.g. 2Ã—2 tiles)
- Customize screw holes, chamfers, and connector slots
- Export and print!
