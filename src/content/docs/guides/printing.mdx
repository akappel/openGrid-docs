## General advice

Everything you see here is meant to give you some idea what openGrid is designed for and what the general
recommendations are. This does by no means limit openGrid to be only printable with those settings. Just
remember - especially if you are using different settings - to **do a test print first** and see whether everything
looks right. Doing such a test print is always a good first step, as normally you want to cover a larger area,
you don't want to produce plastic waste just by skipping this step.

If you run into issues please always check the setup and settings to at least document what you did differently
when asking about support. Ideally test the recommended settings also.

## Nozzle and layer height

openGrid is designed with a **0.4mm nozzle** and a **layer height of 0.2mm** in mind. This does not mean it will not work
with different settings, I know people have been using a 0.6mm nozzle without issues for example.

## Print settings

Most of the time the default settings work just fine. I would recommend to increase the **perimeter / outer wall count to 3**
if you want to attach more weight. Besides this the infill pattern and densite does normally not matter much. Use at least
15% infill.

If your printer support some sort of "standard" / "structural" and "speed" profile all of those should normally work.
But remember to do a test print first. Faster profiles might decrease print quality and as of this ruin the tolerances.

## Material

Printing openGrid with **PLA is just fine** for most of the use cases. If you have any use cases that are more demanding
you may switch to PETG or ASA/ABS if you like. Don't use flexible materials of course.

## TL;DR - overview of recommendations

* Material: PLA (or PETG)
* Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm
* Layer height: 0.2mm
* Infill: Use default pattern and at least 15%
* Perimeters / outer wall count: >= 3

Do a test print first. Document differences when asking for support.
