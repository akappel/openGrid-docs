title: Board
# description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

## Board Types

### Full Board

Use this where more havy use cases.

Specs:

- grid width: 28 mm
- thickness: 6.8 mm

### Lite Board

Perfect for light attachments like [Underware 2.0](https://handsonkatie.com/underware-2-0-the-made-to-measure-collection/) 

Specs:

- grid width: 28 mmm
- thickness: 4 mm

## Connect Boards

Multiple boards can be connected to a larger board using small pegs.
The pegs primarily serve to prevent misalignment but do **not** stop the boards from being pulled apart.

## Mounting

The Lite board has holes in all four corners for mounting it to a surface with screws.

Both board types support [screw snaps](../snaps).
