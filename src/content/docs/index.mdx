## What is openGrid?

**openGrid** is a general-purpose wall and desk mounting framework and ecosystem. Itâ€™s designed with a clear, opinionated structure that emphasizes:

- **Ease of use**
- **Visual simplicity**
- **Modular extensibility**

openGrid is built around a **28mm grid size**, making it **Gridfinity-compatible**, and integrates with systems like **Multiboard**, **HSW**, **GOEWS**, and standard **metric screws**. It also has first-class support for **Underware 2.0**.

All base components are designed to look clean and modern â€” making them *living room compatible*. But the true power of openGrid comes from its flexibility: all modeling and source files are provided, making it easy to remix and extend.

Whether you're a designer, maker, or hobbyist, openGrid is built to grow with your needs. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!

## Why Choose openGrid?

- **Designed for Modularity**: Combine and stack components as needed
